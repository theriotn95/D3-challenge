# D3-challenge - Data Journalism and D3

## Background

I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings.

The data set I workd with was based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler 

I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables: `Healthcare vs. Obesity' to observe the relatiosnhip between the two comparing the states provided.

Using the D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I coded this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function.
